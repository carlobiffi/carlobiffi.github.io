However, current approaches to the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases often rely on subjective human assessment as well as manual analysis of medical images. Both factors limit the sensitivity in quantifying complex structural and functional phenotypes. Deep learning approaches have recently achieved success for tasks such as classification or segmentation of medical images, but lack interpretability in the feature extraction and decision processes, limiting their value in clinical diagnosis. In this work, we propose a 3D convolutional generative model for automatic classification of images from patients with cardiac diseases associated with structural remodeling. The model leverages interpretable task-specific anatomic patterns learned from 3D segmentations. It further allows to visualise and quantify the learned pathology-specific remodeling patterns in the original input space of the images. This approach yields high accuracy in the categorization of healthy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy subjects when tested on unseen MR images from our own multi-centre dataset (100%) as well on the ACDC MICCAI 2017 dataset (90%). We believe that the proposed deep learning approach is a promising step towards the development of interpretable classifiers for the medical imaging domain, which may help clinicians to improve diagnostic accuracy and enhance patient risk-stratification.","tags":null,"title":"Learning Interpretable Anatomical Features Through Deep Generative Models: Application to Cardiac Remodeling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carlo Biffi","Antonio de Marvao","Mark I Attard","Timothy J W Dawes","Nicola Whiffin","Wenjia Bai","Wenzhe Shi","Catherine Francis","Hannah Meyer","Rachel Buchan","Stuart A Cook","Daniel Rueckert","Declan P O’Regan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1506816000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1506816000,"objectID":"bbc4509f0e9b1b3aac08eab0051f2ce7","permalink":"https://carlobiffi.github.io/publication/bio2017/","publishdate":"2017-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bio2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy is a strong predictor of cardiovascular outcomes, but its genetic regulation remains largely unexplained. Conventional phenotyping relies on manual calculation of LV mass and wall thickness, but advanced cardiac image analysis presents an opportunity for high-throughput mapping of genotype-phenotype associations in three dimensions (3D). High-resolution cardiac magnetic resonance images were automatically segmented in 1124 healthy volunteers to create a 3D shape model of the heart. Mass univariate regression was used to plot a 3D effect-size map for the association between wall thickness and a set of predictors at each vertex in the mesh. The vertices where a significant effect exists were determined by applying threshold-free cluster enhancement to boost areas of signal with spatial contiguity. Experiments on simulated phenotypic signals and SNP replication show that this approach offers a substantial gain in statistical power for cardiac genotype-phenotype associations while providing good control of the false discovery rate. This framework models the effects of genetic variation throughout the heart and can be automatically applied to large population cohorts.","tags":null,"title":"Three-Dimensional Cardiovascular Imaging-Genetics: A Mass Univariate Framework","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carlo Biffi","Juan Cerrolaza","Giacomo Tarroni","Wenjia Bai","Ozan Oktay","Loic Le Folgoc","Konstantinos Kamnitsas","Antonio de Marvao","Georgia Doumou","Jinming Duan","Sanjay Prasad","Stuart Cook","Declan O Regan","Daniel Rueckert"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c0f710f8a0ea7764efcba46731b6e610","permalink":"https://carlobiffi.github.io/publication/tmi2020/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tmi2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Quantification of anatomical shape changes currently relies on scalar global indexes which are largely insensitive to regional or asymmetric modifications. Accurate assessment of pathology-driven anatomical remodeling is a crucial step for the diagnosis and treatment of many conditions. Deep learning approaches have recently achieved wide success in the analysis of medical images, but they lack interpretability in the feature extraction and decision processes. In this work, we propose a new interpretable deep learning model for shape analysis. In particular, we exploit deep generative networks to model a population of anatomical segmentations through a hierarchy of conditional latent variables. At the highest level of this hierarchy, a two-dimensional latent space is simultaneously optimised to discriminate distinct clinical conditions, enabling the direct visualisation of the classification space. Moreover, the anatomical variability encoded by this discriminative latent space can be visualised in the segmentation space thanks to the generative properties of the model, making the classification task transparent. This approach yielded high accuracy in the categorisation of healthy and remodelled left ventricles when tested on unseen segmentations from our own multi-centre dataset as well as in an external validation set, and on hippocampi from healthy controls and patients with Alzheimer's disease when tested on ADNI data. More importantly, it enabled the visualisation in three-dimensions of both global and regional anatomical features which better discriminate between the conditions under exam. The proposed approach scales effectively to large populations, facilitating high-throughput analysis of normal anatomy and pathology in large-scale studies of volumetric imaging.","tags":null,"title":"Explainable Anatomical Shape Analysis through Deep Hierarchical Generative Models","type":"publication"}]
